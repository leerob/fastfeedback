# Getting Started

Welcome to Fast Feedback! üëãüèº

To get started adding feedback to your site, retrieve the site ID
from the URL and place this iframe inside your site.

`<iframe src="https://fastfeedback.io/embed/SITE_ID" />`

## Multiple Routes

If you want to add feedback to multiple routes in a single site,
forward a unique slug for that route.

`<iframe src="https://fastfeedback.io/embed/SITE_ID/ROUTE" />`

This is perfect for adding comments to a blog or product reviews.

## Automatic Resizing

When embedding your feedback iframe, you might want it to automatically resize the
height to its contents. This can be achieved using [iframe-resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer).

For example, if you are using React, you can add [iframe-resizer-react](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer-react) and do
something like this.

```
<IframeResizer
    checkOrigin={false}
    title="Comments"
    src={`https://fastfeedback.io/embed/SITE_ID`}
    style={{
        width: '1px',
        minWidth: '100%'
    }}
/>
```

## API

If you'd like to completely customize the look of your feedback, you can use our API.
